If you know data science programming languages like Python, R, SQL, or JavaScript(to name a few), you can use those for this activity. You can also use Excel & its chart/graph functionality as well.

QUESTIONS:
1. The most often used metric for overall rate of spread of the disease for a particular geography is casesper capita, which is the number of cases in that region divided by the population. Please calculate theinfection rate per capita by state for June 2020 (if using data from class activity) or for June 2021 if using GitHub data.

2. Plot the infection rate by state (per capita as above) by day for 2021 for the largest 4 states in the US;Florida, California, Texas, and New York.

3. Using the infections data and recent trends in how cases are moving, please come up with amethodology for forecasting the number of cases you expect to see in these 4 states for the next 90days.4.Compare your forecasts to the one from the Institute of Health Metrics at the University of Washington(https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections)? How are your forecasts similar or different?
